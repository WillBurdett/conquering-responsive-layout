Notes:

Hero images
- By default an image will stretch to fill it's parent div
- Avoid this by putting in a div OR 'align-items: flex-start'
- 'justify-content' is used to space content (space-between used most)
- This only works if the columns are not taking up 100% of the width of the parent div
- Always set global 'img' a max-width of 100% to always avoid side-scrollimng
