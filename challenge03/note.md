Notes:

Flex
- 'display: flex;' on a parent container will automatically create a flex row of it's child divs
- The child divs will create columns of their elements

Creating space between columns
- [Not available yet] Use 'gap: 100px' in your '.row'
- '.col + .col' selects any column that has an adjacent sibling before it
